Nic Suther,27,Female,BeReal,,0,"I have never heard of or used any of the social media apps mentioned in this survey. I have never even seen ads for these apps. There is so much app competition in the social media space it is becoming over-saturated. There is always a new chat app, dating app, messaging app, video call app, community and forum app, or social media app to download. People's devices can only hold so much space and memory. I already use Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, WhatsApp, Kik, Wickr, YouTube, Snapchat, Skype, Zoom, Webex, Google Meets/Hangouts, Microsoft Teams, Twitch, Discord, and more. The app oversaturation is getting irritating and overwhelming. I have to keep on uninstalling and reinstalling apps for space. I also have gaming apps that take up space. If these new or newer, lesser known social media/chat apps take up too much device space and aren't popular enough then I won't bother downloading them.",Like I said before: never heard of or ever used any of the apps given as a selection option. The survey just wouldn't let me skip over the question without picking an app.,These newer apps need better promotional marketing and advertising to increase publicity. Maybe hire some popular influencers with lots of clout and followers to endorse and sponsor these newer apps to snag users from the more popular Big Tech apps like Instagram or TikTok.,,,,,"Instagram and Kik: I like how image-oriented, visually based these apps are. I like the streaming options, filter options, live video chat options, the options to ""verse"" and ""game"" against other users in-stream, gifting users, app credits, badges, different user levels, animated features and special effects, moderator options, privacy settings and block options, the ability to livestream with multiple people, being able to screenshare on live, app-specific emojis, etc",Some apps do not allow you to share animated/moving gifs or sharing animated/moving gifs does not work. Most apps use loud autoplay as the default setting which is very disruptive and annoying for many users. App developers/moderators do not promptly and fairly respond to user issues and complaints in a relevant and timely manner. Apps should notify users when their stream is being screenrecorded or their page is being screenrecorded (just like how Snapchat notifies users when a screenshot has been taken).,Never heard of either,,,canadian_civilian@protonmail.com,,1,,Thanks for filling out the survey! ,,,3/25/2022 19:04:38,aa7r1bp97dprozm8h6faa7r10l5e5dpx
